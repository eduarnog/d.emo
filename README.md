# d.emo - 
This project aims to develop a tool for documenting 
and applying visual identities with the help of 
generative design. I've been working on this project 
since 2022, when I created a prototype using javaScript(P5.js) 
and conducted initial user and market research better to 
understand the state of brand consistency in visual design. 
In this software, a group of users will input a design system 
and defines the rules by which the tool will generate layout 
variations. D.emo will allow users with less visual design
expertise to create visual communication while keeping brand 
consistency. 

Since I already had some understanding of HTML and CSS basic 
functionalities, in this exercise, I explored some concepts 
that I needed clarification on, like CSS variables, flexbox 
parameters, writing a good HTML structure, and CSS 
responsiveness. I created a login flow that allowed me to 
test some ideas for designing this product. For sure, there 
are many good practices that I still need to learn regarding 
front-end development, so let me know how I can optimize this 
code.
