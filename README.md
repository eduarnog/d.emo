This project aims to develop a tool for documenting and applying visual identities with the help of generative design.I've been working in this project since 2022, where I created my first prototype using javaScript (P5.js) and conducted user and market research.
The user input: design system rules(designers), content(anyone).
output: Various layout combinations based on identity guidelines
Reflection: Since I already had a good understanding of HTML and CSS basic functionalities, I decided to go a bit further and explore some concepts that were not so clar to me: CSS variables, flexbox, referencing in HTML and CSS responsiveness.
